""" A stagnation temperature probe is mounted on the nose cone of a supersonic aircraft.  A normal shock wave stands in
front of the tip of the probe.  The measured stagnation temperature pressure is T_t = 488 K as the jet cruises at an
altitude of z = 15 km with ambient temperature T_a = 217 K and ambient pressure P_a = 12 kPa.

Find:
	-the Mach number, Ma
	-the velocity of the aircraft, v
	-the static pressure behind the shock wave, P_s
	-the stagnation pressure behind the shock wave, P_t
